# Churn-Analysis


### Project 1: Inference 
The project aims to exploit the problem of churn of customers from a telecommunications company.  The data set contains observations from the portfolio of customers of  a telecommunications company, with some detail on the usage during the previous period. There is also some demographic information.

The aim of the project is to check which variables are related to churn. Important: we do not care at this project for prediction. Things that you need to consider are the following (but clearly not restricted to them)

    Which variables are important?
    Do we need to transform them?
    How good is the model?
    Are there any assumptions that need to be check carefully?

You have to write a detailed enough report to explain to your boss about that, explaining the model you used together with sufficient technical details on what you have done.   Use tables and plots that really contribute to your story. Explain what other information you may need.


### Project 2: Prediction & Clustering

You are still working with the churn data but now you have two different tasks to take care
1. Your boss asked to create a model for prediction of churn, you need to predict who is going to churn in order to offer him a better program. Now you care only about prediction. You need to employ at least two methods, compare them and demonstrate their predictive ability.
2. At the same time the marketing department wants to cluster the users so as to be able to run different marketing strategies. They care about clustering based on the usage behavior of the client. Please help them. Ignore any information about churn, you care only on the usage.
For both you need to explain the methods you have used, select the variables you think as useful, check how good is your prediction/clustering. For your report keep in mind that your report will be consider by someone with small knowledge of the methods so you need to explain them in a rigorous but simple way. Avoid using output from R. You need one report which can have different sections.
